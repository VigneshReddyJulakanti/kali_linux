BASICS

--> Open terminal  : ctrl + alt + T

--> shows current directory : pwd

--> As which user are u logged in as : whoami

--> To open any root directory : cd /dir_name_to_be_opened
--> To open a directory : cd dir_name_to_be_opened

-->To move back in dir : cd ..          { you can even use " .. .." to move to dir back , you can even use " .. .. .." to move 3 dir back

--> listing the components of a dir : ls
--> listing components of a particular dir : ls dir
--> to see more details in listing : ls -l             { THis is called long listing}
-->Some are hidden to see them we need to use -a : ls -la

--> For help command name followed by  :        --help or -h or -?              { if one doesn't work use other one }  { ex :   aircrack -ng --help      or  nmap -h  }

--> To open manual page for any command , use man before command : man nmap   { Now this will open the manual page u can scroll using the enter button or scroll up and scroll down , and enter q to exit } 


LOCATE SOMETHING

--> locate followed by the thing to be located will give the info , but this will give a lot info  and is updated only once a day so u can not get the file u created minutes ago : locate nmap  { Will display its every occurance } 


--> to search binary : whereis nmap { This will return the binary file location , manual page if available and the source code  , but not its every occurance 

--> TO get the location of binary in the path variable  : which nmap

FInd

--> Basic syntax : find directory options expression
ex : find / -type f -name apache2
Here f stands for normal file type
This command will only search the given directory and gives only the fully corectly matched results

This also do not find the files that have extensions other than the name 
so to escape from this problem we use wildcards
ex : find / -type f -name apache2.*
SO now it wiil show files with all extensions





Conventions in LInux

-> Use single dash before a single letter options such as -a  { exceptions : in find before type and name only single -}

-> Use double dash before a word options such as --help
